# REMS

## Overview

REMS (Rust-based Electromagnetic Multi-layer Solver) is a software package for finding electromagnetic modes in multi-layered media. It is written in Rust and implements both the scattering and transfer matrix method.

## Roadmap

- [x] Base scattering matrix method solver implementation
- [ ] Base transfer matrix method solver implementation
- [ ] Field calculation using transfer matrix method
- [ ] Field calculation using scattering matrix method
- [ ] Python bindings
